First they define a doublet as an object where any 2 heavy atoms in nucleotides
i and i+1 are less that 4 Angstrom apart, the heavy atoms used are not all but
just 3 in the base and 3 in the backbone.
Then they use k-means (with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation">
RMSD</a> as the metric) and to be able to specify the
number of clusters <b>(n)</b>
that they want to come out of the data, they vary <b>n</b> as 10, 20, 30
40, 50 and 100. Of course the clusters are just sets of data so
these sets are given the name of libraries.
The cut off for X-ray resolution is 4 Angstrom

<b>Lucas and Dill 2003 JCP</b>

<br>
Two problems are the main ones in RNA  theory
<br>
<br>
1)Predict  native structure  based on  its nucleotide
sequence.
<br>
2)Predict folding thermodynamics.
<br>
<br>
The second point  is the one that Dill's group  has mainly focused its
attention  using   a  statistical  thermodynamics   model  coupled  to
secondary structure  graphs which are treated using  so called polymer
graphs. For treating pseudoknots  this are split into "pseudoknot core
units" and  then determine the  number of conformations for  this core
units.

<br>
<br>
In contrast  to   the  problem  of   protein  folding,  RNA   folding  is
hierarchical in that its secondary  structure is much more stable than
its    tertiary   structure,    which    can   be    treated   as    a
perturbation. Experimentally, the two levels of folding (secondary and
tertiary) can be separated by  varying the concentration of Mg++ ions.

<br>
RNA Folding  in vitro and  in vivo  can be
comparable in  some situation  but not in  others.  It seems  that RNA
folding  can be facilitated  in vivo  in ocassions  where it  does not
occur in vitro  as in pre-rRNA expression in e.coli.   in vitro and in
vivo scientists  (as opposed to  "in silico" and "in cogito") propose
two models  for large  RNA molecule folding,  that is;
<br>
<br>
1) Random
Coil forms after  transcription, non-directional folding follows (seen
in vitro)
<br>
2) Folding occurs during transcription  as directed by
sequence (proposed for in vivo)
<br>
<br>
<i>3  Facts of transcription  influence the folding process:</i>
<br>
<br>
1) Directionality.
<br>
2) Velocity.
<br>
3) Pausing.
<br>
<br>
Divalent ions are  also mentiones as crucial both in  vivo and in vivo
specially   in   relation   to   splicing  events.    In   prokaryotes
transcription  and  translation   are  coupled.   RNA  chaperones  can
accelerate folding.  ncRNA's can modulate transcription.
It is also said  that as of 2002 in vivo studies  of folding is in its
begginings and "lacks adquate experimental methods".

3 Levels in nucleic acids:
<br>
Sugar == puckers, also torsion angles
<br>
Phosphate backbone == torsion angles as in schneider bergman
<br>
Base == there's where the bonding interactions are at, H-bonds and stacking.
<br>
<br>

<hr>
<b> From Westhof  and Fritsch 2000 Structure</b>
<br>
<br>
There are  diverse base pairs which
are different from traditional,  Watson and Crick or Hooogsteen alone,
for  example  one  G.A  pair   mediated  by  water  to  make  hydrogen
bonds. They reinforce the  concept of  the 3 faces  of bases, that  is, W-C
edge,  Hoogsteeen edge  and Shallow  groove edge,  it points  out that
H-bonding in the shallow groove is common. Also interstrand and cross-strand stacking.
Remarks W-C form helical framework and points out non W-C are primordial
in RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interaction.
<br>
RNA Tertiary (RNA-RNA interactions):
<br>
==> Between helices.
<br>
==> Between unpaired regions.
<br>
==> Between unpaired and double standed helix.
